# Get started with Azure 2.0 CLI Preview

1. [Install Azure CLI 2.0 Preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/master/doc/preview_install_guide.md)
on whatever platform you use.

2. Run the `az` command to verify the installation.

3. Log in to your Azure account.

    `az login`

    You'll be prompted to open https://aka.ms/devicelogin and enter a code.

    `To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://aka.ms/devicelogin. Enter the code ******** to authenticate.`

    You'll be prompted to log in using your credentials.

Now you can run [any command](../../cli) that accesses your account. If you have feedback, use `az feedback` to let us know.
